Graph:

* If you don't care about length of the path - DFS

* If you want to travel limited/ Shortest path - BFS

* DAG - Topo sort (sometimes with dp)

* Weighted directed/undirected shortest path - Dijkstra

* (-ve) wt - Bellman ford

* All pairs of shortest path - Floyd Warshall

* If you want to find if two node belong to the same component in constant time - DSU
